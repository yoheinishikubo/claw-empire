# API Contract Baseline

This document defines a contributor-facing API baseline for Claw-Empire.
It is intentionally compact and focused on frequently used endpoints.

## Base

- Base URL (local): `http://127.0.0.1:8790`
- API prefix: `/api`
- Health endpoint: `/healthz`
- Swagger UI: `/api/docs`
- OpenAPI JSON: `/api/openapi.json`

## Authentication

- Loopback/local usage usually works without extra headers.
- Remote/non-loopback deployments can require:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <API_AUTH_TOKEN>`
- Inbox webhook endpoint requires:
  - `x-inbox-secret: <INBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`
- Swagger note:
  - `/api/docs` opens with an automatic `/api/auth/session` bootstrap attempt (loopback/local case).
  - If you still get `401 unauthorized`, set `Bearer <API_AUTH_TOKEN>` via Swagger `Authorize`.

## Common Error Shape

Error payloads can vary by route, but API clients should handle:

```json
{
  "error": "error_code",
  "message": "human-readable detail"
}
```

The frontend client wraps non-2xx responses with `ApiRequestError` (`status`, `code`, `details`, `url`).

## Known Follow-up

- Promote this baseline to OpenAPI (`/api/*.yaml`) in incremental slices:
  1. auth/session + settings
  2. tasks/subtasks
  3. inbox/directives
  4. project/github/update routes
